These icons were created by Caz Wolf and 
are available for purchase on itch.io:

https://cazwolf.itch.io/

These icons are available for use in non-commercial
and paid projects, with credit to Caz Wolf, as
well as permission to edit the icons provided
credit is still given for the original work.

You must own the original RPG Maker MV RTP in order
to use the equipment icons for Harold, Therese, 
Marsha and Lucius, as they are based on these
characters which I do not own.

I would ask that you please do not redistribute 
this pack to other parties without linking
to the original itch.io page. Thank you!

enjoy the pack!
