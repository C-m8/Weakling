    <h1>Hello adventurer!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Weakling, an open source RPG game.</p>
    <p>This is just the beginning and very much work in progress on it's early stage, but there are already a few things
        you can do to explore it yourself!</p>
    <p>Please, use <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to navigate the world, and
        <strong>Space</strong> to move between locations and interact with certain objects (highlighted with the purple
        frame). Other actions are done with the mouse.</p>
    <p>For more information and project-related links please read <a href="https://telegra.ph/Introducing-Weakling-12-23" target="_blank">an Introduction</a>. Thank you and enjoy!</p>
