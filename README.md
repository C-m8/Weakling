If you are interested in learning Phaser 3, here is the general article where I covered some resources I used to learn Phaser, as well as ones I use for the reference: https://telegra.ph/Phaser-3-Materials-and-learning-02-12

If you want to know more about the development process, or even wish to join me, feel free to check out Trello board for more information:

All games assets are free to use under different free licenses (as far as I can say ._.), all the credit for it goes to their authors.

UPD: Oups..not anymore - I borrowed the doll image from the heroes 3 and a couple others, will definitely replace it in the future. 
If you see any art which you believe is yours, and would like to be credited, or it to be removed immediately - please create the issue request (or use any other way to contact me), I will do it with the highest priority.

Can somebody draw replacements for me, please >_<
