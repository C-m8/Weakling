# Weakling
HTML5 RPG game sketch built with Phaser 3 and typescript

This is very much work in progress game with 3 scenes available to explore - World Map, House and Fight - none of which are completed.

To check it out, please go to https://nightspeller.github.io/Weakling/ and try to poke around until you break something (or stuck at the house - there is no exit from there for now)

To run it locally just checkout from the repo and use the web server of your choice to load index.html in your browser.

To compile you will need to do npm install and use typescript compiler to work with (and, well, compile) .ts files.

All games assets are free to use under different free licenses (as far as i can say ._.), all the credit for it goes to their authors.
UPD: ahaha not anymore - i stole the doll image from the heroes 3 xD. Can somebody draw one for me please >_<
