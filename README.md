# Weakling
HTML5 RPG game sketch built with Phaser 3 and typescript

This is very much work in progress game with a few locations available to explore - The city of Caltor, House, Village and Battle - none of which are completed.

Read more about it in this post: https://telegra.ph/Introducing-Weakling-12-23.

To check it out, please go to https://nightspeller.github.io/Weakling/ and try to poke around until you break something :-)

To run it locally, just checkout from the repo and use the web server of your choice to load index.html in your browser.

To compile it, you will need to do npm install and use typescript compiler to work with (and, well, compile) .ts files.

If you want to know more about the development process, or even wish to join me, feel free to check out Trello board for more information:

All games assets are free to use under different free licenses (as far as i can say ._.), all the credit for it goes to their authors.

UPD: Oups..not anymore - I borrowed the doll image from the heroes 3 and a couple others, will definitely replace it in the future. 
If you see any art which you believe is yours, and would like to be credited or it to be removed immediately - please create the issue request (or use any other way to contact me), I will do it with the highest priority.

Can somebody draw replacements for me, please >_<
